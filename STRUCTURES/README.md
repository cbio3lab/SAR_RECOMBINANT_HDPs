# STRUCTURES

The structural information of the HDPs was obtained from:

1. human α-defensin 5 (HD5, PDB code 2lxz106)

2. human β-defensin 2 (HβD2, PDB code 1fd3107)

3. human β-defensin 3 (HβD3, PDB code 1kj6108)

4. cathelicidin (LL37, PDB code 5nmn 109).
  
6. β-defensin lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP), it was simulated using AlphaFold2104 since its structure is not deposited in the PDB
