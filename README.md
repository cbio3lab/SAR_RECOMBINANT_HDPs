Host defense peptides-based therapeutics represent a valuable class of antimicrobial agents with the potential to address the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we have designed recombinant constructs which are the result of the combination of different host defense peptides (HDPs) to the GFP protein and multidomain proteins combining three or four HDPs, referred as 1st and 2nd generation antimicrobials, respectively. These recombinant peptides were tested against gram-positive (methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) bacteria associated in healthcare-associated infections. 

Furthermore, a state-of-the-art approach to calculate lipophilicity and amphipathicity together with molecular docking studies provided insight into the antimicrobial structure-activity relationships of these biomolecules.
