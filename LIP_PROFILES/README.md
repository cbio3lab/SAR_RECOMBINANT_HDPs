# Lipophilicity profiles of bioactive regions of HDS

The context-dependent lipophilicity of each amino acid was computed using a pH-dependent and structure-based lipophilicity scale called *ProtL scale*.

It is based on the *IEFPCM/MST continuum solvation method*, wherein the lipophilicity of each amino acid is calculated, considering its specific structural features and the pH of the medium. This methodology was implemented as reported in our previous work (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b00028) according to Eq. 1
